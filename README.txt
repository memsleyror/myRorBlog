ok - having 3 key issues right now:

1. cannot get the add/remove comments to work on my nested form on posts/show. note i installed the nested_form gem to make this work and it seems like the javascript doesn't work.

2. my log-out is throwing an error i cannot figure out

that's all for now...otherwise have devise (mostly), cancan, and carrierwave/rmagick working. nested forms are very challenging.

3. destroy no longer works on roles and users...
